ELECTRON 

Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By embedding Chromium and Node.js into its binary, Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux — no native development experience required.
Electron is an open source project maintained by the OpenJS Foundation and an active community of contributors.

## 🕒 Time-Based Character Image Logic

The app dynamically updates the assistant character based on the current system time. This helps create a more responsive and personalized experience.

### 🧠 How it works
We use JavaScript's built-in `Date` object to get the current time:

```js
const now = new Date();
const hours = now.getHours(); // returns 0–23


Based on the hour, the app selects an image using a predefined mapping:

const timeMap = [
    { range: [1, 6], file: '1am6am.png' },
    { range: [6, 8], file: '6am8am.png' },
    // Add other ranges as needed
    { range: [23, 24], file: '11pm12am.png' },
    { range: [0, 1], file: '12am1am.png' },
];
